<h2>Energy storing bricks</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="sp1">Scientists have found a way to store energy in the red bricks</span> that are used to build houses. <div class="div1">Although the research is still in the proof-of-concept stage, the scientists claim that walls made of these bricks “could store a substantial amount of energy” and can “be recharged hundreds of thousands of times within an hour”.</div></p>

<h2>Self-healing ‘living concrete’</h2>
<p class="p2">Scientists have <span class="sp2">developed what they call living concrete by using sand, gel and bacteria</span>. The team from the University of Colorado Boulder believe their work paves the way for future building structures that could “heal their own cracks, suck up dangerous toxins from the air or even glow on command”.</p>

<h2>Living robots</h2>
<p class="p3">Tiny hybrid <span class="sp3">robots made using stem cells from frog embryos</span> could one day be used to swim around human bodies to specific areas requiring medicine,<div class="div2">or to gather microplastic in the oceans.</div></p>

<h2>Heart monitoring T-shirt</h2>
<p class="p4">Using a single lead ECG printed into the fabric, this new t-shirt from smart materials company KYMIRA will <span class="sp4">accurately measure heart beats and upload them to the cloud via Bluetooth</span>. Once there, algorithms process the data to accurately detect irregular heartbeats such as arrhythmia heart beats, which could prove life saving.</p>

<h2>Coffee power</h2>
<p class="p5">London’s coffee industry creates over 200,000 tonnes of waste every year, so what do we do with it? Entrepreneur <div class="div3">Arthur Kay’s big idea is to use his company, bio-bean</div>, to <span class="sp5">turn 85 per cent of coffee waste into biofuels for heating buildings and powering transport.</span></p>

<h2>Drown forest fires in sound</h2>
<p class="p6">Forest fires could one day be dealt with by drones that would direct loud noises at the trees below. Since sound is made up of pressure waves, <span class="sp6">it can be used to disrupt the air surrounding a fire</span>, essentially cutting off the supply of oxygen to the fuel. At the right frequency, the fire simply dies out, as researchers at George Mason University in Virginia recently demonstrated with their sonic extinguisher. Apparently, bass frequencies work best.</p>

<h2>The AI scientist</h2>
<p class="p7">Although humans still need to feed the AI with information, the machine in this experiment was able to <span class="sp7">create a new, abstract theory independently</span> – a huge step towards the development of a conscious computer, and potentially a landmark step in the way we carry out research.</p>

<h2>Space balloon</h2>
<p class="p8">If you want to take a trip into space, your quickest bet might be to take a balloon. <span class="sp8">The company World View Enterprises wants to send tourists into the stratosphere</span>, 32km above Earth, on hot air balloons.</p>

<h2>Crowd-sourced antibiotics</h2>
<p class="p9">Swallowing seawater is part of surfing. But now the scientists behind a new initiative called Beach Bums want to swab the rectums of surfers, <span>to see if this water contains the key to developing new antibiotics</span>. They’re searching for antibiotic resistant bacteria known as superbugs: by studying the samples from the surfers, they hope to learn more about these potentially dangerous organisms in the hope of producing new drugs to combat them.</p>

<h2>Pleistocene Park</h2>
<p class="p10">Russian scientist Sergey Zimov hopes to <span>recreate a 12,000-year-old environment <div class="div4">in a wildlife park for herbivores like wild horse and bison, with extinct megafauna like mammoths</div> replaced by modern hybrids</span>. Zimov will study the impact of the animals on environment and climate.</p>
